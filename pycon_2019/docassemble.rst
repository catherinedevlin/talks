doc... assemble?
================

Assemble (legal, -ish) documents 

.. note::

  High-level platform for developing very specialized web apps.

  documentation as in "paperwork".  Legalese.

  Developed Jonathan Pyle in the community of legal nonprofits.

  Assembling the documents is an uncommon need; 

----

Interviews
==========

(gathering info from users)

.. note::

  This part, however, is not uncommon at all. 
  You can use a docassemble interview to get data,
  then not assemble a document with it, but store 
  it to a database, submit it to a RESTful API, 
  or whatever.

  So docassemble is actually nowhere near as specialized 
  as it thinks it is.  I look at it as a platform to ask a 
  user questions.
