91% of Americans “agree” or “strongly agree” that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used by all kinds of entities.

Americans’ lack of confidence in communications security is accompanied by low levels of trust in government and advertisers

Education doesn't help!

Currently, just 18% of adults believe that the government in Washington can be trusted to do what is right either all (2%) or most (16%) of the time, while another 67% say that the government can be trusted only some of the time and 14% say it can never be trusted. As has been the case in other surveys, there are significant differences by education level, as adults who did not attend college are more likely to say the government can “never” be trusted (21%) compared with those with at least some college experience (9%).

I am not asking for your trust!

I want informed oversight!

Despair, contempt, learned helplessness with accompanying resentment
