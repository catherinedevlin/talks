    People increasingly know that data is important
    and effects them.

    And it's a mystery to them.


    18f cynicism
      the disclaimer

    polling stats

    not asking you to trust your government!

    not just government -
      or other aspects of communal life


    learned helplessness - abdicate informed
      sinclair


  so where were we?
  oh, yeah, we were complaining about the dark side of
    developing a ruling caste armed with ill-understood powers

  irony: what drew me into Python was the amateur friendliness

  let's talk about chickens.

  small farms, food gardens

  these don't replace big industrial farming

  but they do improve awareness, connectivity

  what if we had small, organic, local data farming?

What do I mean?  What can we teach amateurs about using data ?


  getting data
    apis

      define it.  That's a very jargony term.
      api use
      open data hubs
        data.gov
          FEC
          Crime Data Explorer
          USASpending
        beware intimidating quantity
      api use
      api finding

  getting from other sources
    automate the boring
    csv
    scraping
    basic pdfs
    bulk data processing (what did I mean here?)


  analyzing it
    seeing theory
    visualizing: Altair
    but this is probably not the biggest.  most people are not itching for
      detail beyond maybe an average.  qualitative

  projects
    local views of national data
    amalgamate local entries : guides, directories, calendars
      local events
      local libraries
      local parks




teaching

  traditional
    math / abstract
    websites
    games
    but everybody is affected by data
  who
    students (see Jessica's keynote)
    local government (see tweet)
    journalists
    small businesspeople
    activists
  how
    data carpentry
    julia evans
    code for dayton
    jupyter notebooks
    seeing theory
    beware
      weeding
      jargon (API)

make it easy
  package the data better
    quilt
    use standards


  write better packages
  wrap existing packages
    requests
    wrap existing APIs: twitter API
  connect existing packages
    ipython-sql
  improve docs
    file documentation issues
  speak
    local groups
    non-software groups
  blog
  signal-boost
    signal-boost good sources, not just tools
    make curated

ambitions
  kitchen computer?
  civic engagement
  fear of disenfranchisement, data breaches, big institutions
    informed fear
    uninformed fear == learned helplessness
  strengten local
  empower buying
  diversity and participation in design
    diverse teams
    people give feedback when they understand
    broader pipeline
  open data
    it's more valuable when it's consumed more

    consumers create demand
    food labels
    no pdfs
  date ethics
    awareness of bias
